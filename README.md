  Iâ€™m Matteo Larrode, Volunteer Data Scientist at [Lâ€™Equipage Solidaire](https://delivraide.org), a French non-profit that delivers food and hygenic supplies to students in need at their home, for free. I believe that data can be a powerful tool for positive change, and I am committed to using my skills to help make a difference.
  
  I study Politics, Economics and Philosophy at University College London (UCL) with a specialization in Social Data Science. I am passionate about research and I love the mix of quantitative methods and social science questions my degree has to offer. Currently in a year abroad in Washington DC, at the George Washington University, I am taking classes in data mining, data vizualization and data analytics for International Relations. I also work with Dr. Laila Sorurbakhsh, on a quantitative study of interest group behaviour in the face of policy risk. As a side project, Dr. Emmanuel Teitelbaum and I are developing a [RShiny app](https://matteolarrode.shinyapps.io/mapelectionsindia/?_ga=2.69934096.1295429016.1680480062-1674700938.1679507361) mapping election results in India.
  
 During my activity as a volunteer data scientist, in academia, and through other side-projects like the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenge, I had the opportunity to gain experience in natural language processing, spatial analysis, regression and time-series analysis, in R, Python and Tableau.

  On this GitHub, expect to see my evolution as projects, alongside other side projects such as the #TidyTuesday challenge.
