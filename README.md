  <br>
  
  I study Politics, Economics and Philosophy at University College London (UCL) with a specialization in Social Data Science. I am passionate about research and absolutely adore the mix of quantitative methods and humaninities subjects that my degree has to offer. 
  
  <br>
  
  Currently in a year abroad in  Washington DC, at the George Washington University. I am taking classes of data mining, data vizualization and data analytics for International Relations. I work with Laila Sorurbakhsh, PhD, on a quantitative study of interest group behaviour in the face of policy risk. I am also developing a RShiny app to build an interactive map of Indian election results, in collaboration with Emmanuel Teitelbaum, PhD.

  On this GitHub, expect to see the evolution of these projects, alongside other personal undertakings like the #TidyTuesday challenge.
